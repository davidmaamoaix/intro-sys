Labs and work for CMU 15-213.

Just realized that I haven't actually put together the random code pieces from 15-213 to form actually functional submissions.

Umm and the code here doesn't really follow the lab machine requirement and stuff cuz I'm not a CMU student and don't have access to Autolab, but the concept demonstrated in the code is essentially the same.

The starter materal is gathered from [here](https://github.com/JonnyKong/CMU-15-213-Intro-to-Computer-Systems). I went in and grabbed each lab's starter code from its first commit, and checked all relevant code to make sure that they are empty. Nonetheless, some 'not starter code' might have slipped in.

The stripped starter code is in the `starter-code` branch. If you are not a CMUer then I guess you can also try it out.

btw this repo might \*pfff\* disappear in the future if I'm fortunate enough to get into CMU, as publishing lab solution is probably against the academic integrity policy or something. But as long as I remain in highschool, life should be good.
